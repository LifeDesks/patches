Patches
=======

Custom patches for Drupal core and contributed modules extracted from legacy
LifeDesks code.

These patches are not necessarily bug fixes, in some cases they are just
overrides that were placed directly into contributed modules following bad
development practices. Typically we would place these types of overrides into
custom modules. However, since this is legacy code and LifeDesks development is
suspended, we are instead, minimally maintaining these customizations as patches
for documentation and deployment purposes.
